# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome — this folder contains OctoAcme's project management process documentation. Use this README as a single navigational entry point for onboarding and ongoing reference.

Purpose
- Provide a concise summary of how OctoAcme runs projects.
- Surface the key artifacts, roles, and workflows teams use day-to-day.
- Link to the full process documents for deeper guidance.

Quick process summary
- Initiation: Projects start with a one-pager that defines the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and go/no‑go criteria.
- Planning: Turn an approved initiative into an actionable backlog, identify dependencies/risks, estimate scope, and define the Definition of Done.
- Execution & tracking: Work is tracked on a project board with a steady team rhythm (standups, weekly syncs, demos). PRs follow small-change, CI-first practices and include acceptance criteria.
- Release & deployment: Releases follow a checklist with pre-release checks, staging verification, smoke tests, and a rollback playbook.
- Risks & communication: Maintain a risk register, follow an escalation path, and use structured stakeholder communications (weekly status, incident summaries).
- Continuous improvement: Run retrospectives after sprints/releases/incidents and track action items back into the backlog.
